Not much, just catching up on some old movies. You? Did you manage to finish that big project we talked about? I'm totally swamped with emails right now, it's driving me crazy. Want to grab a quick coffee before the 10 AM meeting? Oh wow, seriously? That's hilarious, you have to tell me the whole story. Gotta run, my dog is causing chaos in the living room. Sounds like a plan, I'll see you around 7 o'clock then. How is your new apartment working out for you so far? What are your major plans for the upcoming long weekend? Ugh, I think I left my lunch at home again. That new action movie was actually much better than I expected. I completely agree with your take on the recent news events. Got any good recommendations for a casual dinner spot tonight? I just forwarded you the document, let me know if you can open it. Long time no talk! It feels like ages since we last caught up. You absolutely won't believe the weird thing that happened at the gym. Thank you so much for picking up my dry cleaning, you’re a lifesaver. Nah, I don't think I can make it to the party on Saturday. Sweet! That's confirmed, I'm really looking forward to it. What did you think of the latest episode of that streaming show? I spent all weekend trying to assemble some flat-pack furniture. My flight was delayed for three hours, and I am exhausted. I’m craving something completely unhealthy right now, like chips and dip. Are you free to help me move this heavy box on Thursday? I'm going to take a mental health day tomorrow, I really need a break. The weather has been perfect for sitting outside and reading all day. I finally got around to replacing that burned-out lightbulb. I'm trying to decide what kind of dessert to make for the party. That new song is constantly stuck in my head, it’s so catchy. I think I'll try to find a cheap flight somewhere warm next month. Did you see the local newspaper article about the city council changes? I'm running low on gas; I need to stop at a station soon. We should plan a game night with everyone next week. What’s the name of that restaurant you were recommending last week? I can't find my headphones anywhere, have you seen them? How long have you been living in this neighborhood now? My internet connection has been absolutely terrible all day long. Let's just meet at the central park entrance at noon. I accidentally deleted all my photos from the camping trip. I need to get up early tomorrow for a doctor's appointment. That’s a really tough decision to make, I don't envy you. Did you remember to water the plants while I was out of town? I’ll send you a reminder text on Friday morning. What kind of books are you usually into reading? I’m thinking about signing up for a beginner’s cooking class. I heard they are finally renovating the old library building. What's the biggest accomplishment you've had this year so far? I feel like I need a long vacation somewhere remote and quiet. Have you had any luck selling your old bike yet? I'm just going to wear a simple shirt and jeans, it’s super casual. My cat is behaving very strangely today, just staring at the wall. Did you get the chance to speak with the manager about the issue? I think we need to reschedule our call to a better time. That was probably the worst cup of tea I’ve ever tasted. I'm completely worn out from working in the garden all morning. What's the latest gossip you’ve heard around the office? I should probably start saving money instead of buying silly gadgets. I finally learned how to properly parallel park my car. That's a very old joke, but it still made me laugh a lot. I was just talking about you with my brother yesterday. How did your little sister do on her school play performance? I’m trying to cut back on caffeine for a little while. Do you want to come over and watch the game on my huge new TV? I really miss having a proper home-cooked meal right now. I think the bus will be here in about five to seven minutes. Can you believe how fast the time has been flying recently? I heard that bookstore downtown is having a massive clearance sale. Should we take the subway or just walk the short distance? I accidentally locked myself out of the house this morning. I need a good recommendation for a reliable local mechanic. That shirt looks really nice on you, where did you buy it? I’ve been thinking about getting a small tattoo for months. That sounds like a whole lot of unnecessary drama, to be honest. Let's just stay home and order delivery for a change. I’m really looking forward to the holidays this year. Did you find anything interesting during your recent apartment hunt? I’m feeling a little bit stressed out about work deadlines. I'll pick up the tickets, and you can pay me back later. What was the funniest meme you saw on the internet today? I was stuck in a massive traffic jam for nearly an hour on the way here. You absolutely won't believe the ridiculous excuse my boss gave this morning. I’m debating whether to start a new show or rewatch an old favorite series. The weather forecast is predicting heavy rain and thunderstorms all night. Do you remember the time we tried to bake that complicated cake recipe? I think the biggest struggle lately is finding enough free time to relax. I need a strong cup of tea because I haven't slept well in days. I just spent forty-five minutes on hold with customer service. I completely lost track of what day of the week it is. We should take a long road trip out of the city next month. I’m trying to learn a little bit of Spanish using an app on my phone. I feel like I've been running errands non-stop since I woke up. Have you ever considered moving to a completely different country? That bakery around the corner has the best cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted. I was late because my alarm clock didn't go off this morning. I spent the evening just trying to figure out my taxes. I completely misplaced my wallet somewhere between here and the store. I think we should talk about the final details of the plan tomorrow morning. I saw an interesting documentary about ancient Roman history last night. I just finished assembling the new bookshelf, and it only took three hours. What was the best gift you received for your last birthday? I need a new pair of running shoes, mine are completely worn out. I think I’ll just wear the blue jacket, it goes with everything. Let's try that new fusion food place for dinner tonight. I’m definitely ready for the clock to hit five o'clock today. Have you tried that new flavor of ice cream yet? I’ll be there in twenty minutes, I’m just finishing up something. I finally got my deposit back from my previous landlord. What’s the craziest rumour you’ve heard this month? I’m trying to teach myself how to knit a scarf. Did you hear that the local library is closing early today? I need to take a break from social media for a while. That sounds like a fantastic idea, let’s definitely do it. Do you have a favorite spot in the city to just relax and unwind? I've been listening to that one musician on repeat lately. I accidentally spilled coffee all over my keyboard this morning. I think I’ll try to go to bed before eleven tonight for once. What’s the most difficult thing you’ve had to learn this year? I need to stop by the bank before it closes at four. That was such a stressful movie, I was on the edge of my seat. I’m just waiting for the next season of that popular series to drop. I can't believe I lost my lottery ticket from last week. Let's just skip the gym today and go for a walk instead. I think I saw your car parked right outside the coffee shop. What’s the most interesting thing you read in the paper this week? I'm going to try to start meal prepping on Sunday afternoons. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain that to me. I’ll bring the snacks, and you bring the board games. How was your experience at the dentist yesterday morning? I completely forgot that today was a public holiday. That new phone update is making my battery drain super fast. I’m thinking of getting rid of my cable TV subscription. What kind of music do you like to listen to while working? I just ran into your old high school history teacher at the mall. I have an important phone call scheduled for four thirty. I think I need to upgrade my computer soon, it’s getting slow. I'm looking forward to finally sleeping in past nine on Saturday. Do you want to go to the farmers market this coming Sunday? I’m just going to have leftovers for lunch today. That store had a massive sale, and I bought way too many things. I finally finished cleaning out the storage unit in the basement. My neighbor got a new puppy, and it barks constantly all night. That new restaurant has an absolutely amazing outdoor patio area. I’m currently stuck in the middle of a major dilemma. I’m thinking about starting a small garden on my balcony. We need to buy a new rug for the living room floor soon. Did you manage to find the keys you lost the other day? I heard the concert tickets sold out within ten minutes. I need to make a few important changes to the final document. That was the most awkward conversation I’ve ever been a part of. I'm going to try to walk to work instead of taking the bus from now on. I'm so bored, do you have any brilliant ideas for things to do? I think I prefer the other style of shoes over these ones. Let’s meet up for a drink on Friday after work is finished. I’m trying to learn more about investing and personal finance. I should probably get going now before the heavy rain starts. What's the weirdest food combination you secretly enjoy eating? I completely forgot to pay that bill yesterday, I need to do it now. Do you want me to bring anything specific to the barbecue this weekend? I’ll call you back as soon as I get out of this meeting. I’m trying to avoid looking at my phone so much during the evenings. That sounds like a massive headache; I hope it gets resolved quickly. I need to find a way to organize all these loose cables I have everywhere. I think I need to buy a ticket for the train ride home. What’s the one thing you absolutely can’t live without? I’m feeling much better today than I was yesterday morning. Did you have a good time at the football game last Sunday? I just bought a new laptop, and I’m setting it up now. What was your favorite class when you were still in college? I accidentally deleted an important file and had to restore the backup. I’m thinking of taking a solo trip somewhere by the ocean soon. I should probably start preparing my clothes for the winter weather. That’s a really interesting perspective, I hadn't thought of that. Let’s try to be on time for the reservation this evening. I'm trying to figure out how to operate this complicated new coffee machine. I’ll have to check my schedule before I can commit to that date. I need to renew my passport before my upcoming vacation. What’s the most ambitious goal you’ve set for yourself this year? I think I’ll buy a nice big plant to put in my office. That was the most crowded public transit ride I have ever experienced. I’m attempting to cook a new, very challenging recipe tonight. I spent two hours trying to find a parking spot downtown today. You seem like you’re in a really good mood this morning. The electricity in my building went out for a few hours last night. I should really start writing down all my ideas in a proper notebook. That was a really impressive performance by the local band. I completely zoned out during that long, boring presentation. I think I’ll cancel my gym membership because I never actually go. I finally got around to unpacking the last box from when I moved. I need to get my eyes checked and probably buy new glasses. Do you have any plans to travel anywhere during the holidays? I’m trying to teach my younger nephew how to play chess. I’ll make sure to double-check the reservation details tonight. That sounds like a much better plan than what we had originally. What was the last truly terrible movie you watched? I’m just going to wear the most comfortable clothes I own today. I think I need to go to bed immediately after I finish this cup of tea. Do you want to come and help me pick out a birthday present for Sam? I’m feeling a little bit more hopeful about the situation now. I’ll see you over by the main clock tower at 3:15 PM sharp.
